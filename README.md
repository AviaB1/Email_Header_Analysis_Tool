# A bit more about this project:
So basically, I was extremely bored and wanted to improve my Python skills. Also, I really wanted to have a GitHub project because it sounds cool! (; I did this project for the fun of it and nothing more. There are a lot of functionalities I could have added, but I wasn't in the mood for that. And also, the code isn't perfect in any way; again - just for the fun of it.

# Disclaimer:
I didn't conduct tons of tests and check every single edge case, so bugs are expected to some extent. Maybe in the near future, I'll add more functionalities to the tool and make it a serious project, but for the time being - it is what it is.
